	We are currently in a closed beta testing period. This is an invite-only beta, so please don't contact us to get access. Currently the only benefit of being a beta tester is the ability to <strong>create polls</strong>. All users are allowed to vote in polls if they have the link, and only if the poll creator didn't set any limits.

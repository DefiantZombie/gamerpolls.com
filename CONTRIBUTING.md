# Contributing

It is easy to contribute to the project. Here is some really basic instructions to get started.

1. Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) if you haven't already.
2. Clone the repo.
3. Open a `node.js` capable shell and `cd` to the project directory.
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
5. Local environment can be configured by copying `default-env.json` to `env.json` and filling in the stuff specific to your environment. Make sure to fill out all the auth keys for Twitch.
6. Run `npm start` to start the server. Point your browser to http://localhost:3000/ to view your local version of the site.

Make the changes you want, then open a pull request.
